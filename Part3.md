Within the massive library, J was running as fast as he could and periodically picking up large books before ripping out pages.  He was like a child throwing a tantrum, and in that tantrum he was destroying and running and destroying.

"Stop!" screamed Craig, who was running almost as quickly.  "These are her memories.  You're killing her!"

"What, these?" asked J, holding a book in his hands with an expression of mock amazement, "these are fucking pieces of paper."  He tried to rip it in half and, failing at that, continued running.

"If you kill her, I'll kill you," said Craig, though it sounded like he wasn't convinced himself.

"That's more cliche than this memory," J responded as he picked up another book.  He read a page to himself.  *Sunset added.  Perfect beach.  Commit 8f71642.  What the heck?*

Craig backtracked, made a different turn, then ran to cut J's path.  The two collided spectacularly, and the force of it knocked J over.  The watch flew out of his hand and the glass nearly shattered.

"That was close," said Craig, as he picked it up.  Everything, books and bookshelves, ceiling and all, suddenly went to paper white.  All that remained was those two, in the infinite empty canvas, like a blank sheet of paper that stretched endlessly before them.

The two of them breathed.  Other than that, there was silence.  J didn't know what was going on, but he was too tired to say anything.  His body ached all over and he hoped nothing was broken.

"People come here from all over," explained Craig, trying to regain his composure.  "They come here broken.  They come here full of sadness, full of longing, and even if you didn't realize it that's exactly what brought you here to me."

"All I heard was a voice that pissed me off, and I wanted to murder whoever had it."

"You ever get low?  Really low.  Not low like you're alone, low like you're alone and the one person in the world who said she would always be there for you just put a noose around her neck."

"Oh my God."

"I know.  I still see that image sometimes, and I can't help but imagine what things would have been like if we'd just had a normal day, and so many normal days after.  Then I realized I could build this perfect world where everything happened exactly as it should have."

"It's not working.  Everything I've seen here is totally screwed up."

"I can give that to you.  Don't you want that?"

Craig pressed a button on his watch.  Instantly the white transformed into a gorgeous scene of a lake.  The light came through the trees and filtered perfectly, but J noticed there were birds flying in the air, suspended, as if they were part of a picture and not a real scene.  Not even a memory.

"I can take the greatest mistakes from your past, and I can let you redo them.  I can make things happen exactly as you know in your heart they should have.  The love of your life can be with you again.  You can have money, kids, fame...whatever you desire and whatever you've known in your heart you've always deserved."

Craig pressed the button again.  "Let's go.  Let's see your most cherished memory."  Everything went white.

"Oh my...what in the..." Craig was incredulous.

"Hey, what do you know?  It's white again."

"There's nothing!" screamed Craig.  "Who are you?  What have you done?"  It was like the very image of white, the image they had just observed, was more than he could handle.  

J nonchalantly walked over to him, took the watch out of his hand, and pressed the button.

"Screw this," said J, and pressed the other button.  They were transported back to the estate, back to the previous day, to repeat their first meeting again for the 1000th time.
