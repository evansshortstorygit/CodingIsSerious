When J got to the gate, he heard an irritating, raspy voice that filled him with such an intense feeling of hatred, he could see flashes of himself carrying out an act of murder.

Who did the voice belong to?  J couldn't remember...it was probably something from his forgotten past, someone he had clashed with a lifetime ago.  He couldn't remember where he had grown up.  He couldn't even remember his name.  J was just a name he came up with out of politeness, while conversing with a polite neighbor he had befriended near the abandoned house where he had woken up.

The abandoned house where he had woken up, without a memory of anything.

This looked like some luxury estate surrounded by nothing, with two massive pillars at the entrance and perfectly symmetrical lights.  The electronic gate opened now, suddenly, and in an instant J realized that there was no speaker on the gate.  The voice must have come, not from this estate's electronic system, but from his own head.  *I must be losing it*, he thought.
