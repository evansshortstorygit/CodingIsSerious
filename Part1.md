When J got to the gate, he heard an irritating, raspy voice that filled him with an intense feeling of anger.

Who did the voice belong to?  J couldn't remember...it was probably something from his forgotten past, someone he had clashed with a lifetime ago.  He couldn't remember where he had grown up.  He couldn't even remember his name.  J was just a name he came up with out of politeness, while conversing with a polite neighbor he had befriended near the abandoned house where he had woken up.

The abandoned house where he had woken up, without a memory of anything.

This looked like some luxury estate surrounded by nothing, with two massive pillars at the entrance and perfectly symmetrical lights.  The electronic gate opened now, suddenly, and in an instant J realized that there was no speaker on the gate.  The voice must have come, not from this estate's electronic system, but from his own head.  *I must be losing it*, he thought.

Inside the impressive, massive estate, inside a comfortable home that looked both authentic and modern with its electronic fireplace and imitation marble, a man named Craig stood near the front door, excited for his new guest to arrive.

"Here he comes," said his wife.  With her tasteful red miniskirt, pink overshirt that matched her sandals, and blonde hair reflecting light in the sun, she looked almost presentable.  "I have to ask, though," she continued, even though she had no right to, "why are you so interested in him?"

"You are a dumb bitch," said Craig.

"What did you just say to me?" she demanded.

"Sorry," said Craig, and he looked down at his watch, "let me redo that."

Time turned back by a few seconds.

"Here he comes," said his wife.  "I have to ask, though, why are you so interested in him?"

This time, Craig simply hauled back and punched her.  For good measure he punched her again, and the force of this sudden act made him feel good.  Powerful.

Craig looked at his watch and reset that clock again.  The blood on his hand reverted to its ordinary, dry color.

"Here he comes," said his wife, "I have to ask, though, why are you so interested in him?"

"Because he's someone who understands," said Craig mysteriously.  "Prepare a drink, I'll be in the basement."

"But he's walking up right now."

"Be nice for him, then."

"I've heard of you," said Craig.  The three of them were sitting at the dinner table now, surrounded by an impressive spread consisting of lasagna, potato casserole, salad, and, as the centerpiece, roasted chicken on a bed of raw spinach and sliced orange.

"Really?" asked J.

"They say you're a genius."

"Who?"

"Everyone," said Craig's wife.  He glared at her for a split second, then turned back to the chicken.  

"Yes, everyone," said Craig, "we heard that you're someone who can do just about anything."
